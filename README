CSharpBot is a bot (created by Merbo, now is owned my Merbo's company, MerbosMagic) created in C#.
It is an up-and-coming bot with growing featues, and soon-to-be SSL support. (currently its all messed up, so we keep you with an SSL-less version) If you wish to be a collaborator, connect to irc://irc.merbosmagic.co.cc/CSharpBot/ , or, the IRC server irc.merbosmagic.co.cc at port 6667/SSL 6697, and join channel #C#Bot (shortcut) or #CSharpBot.
We hope you have a a great time with our bot.
